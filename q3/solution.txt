Solution 1
String1 = ALYHS6L3LF
String2 = EZVW7KADAR
Hash = 0x73e4897
Time elapsed = 7.436496257781982 seconds

Solution 2
String1 = AHTZFMJPI4
String2 = Q95FWLZBUA
Hash = 0x40090dab
Time elapsed = 4.1351540088653564 seconds

Solution 3
String1 = Z39762KEIR
String2 = 8ZNI0KGMST
Hash = 0x3a1e0abf
Time elapsed = 21.894869804382324 seconds
